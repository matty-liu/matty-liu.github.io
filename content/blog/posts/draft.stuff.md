Standing up the blog portion of the site has taken a few weeks. I thought about using some hosted CMS service (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) but I wanted to see what it would take to host this blog posts myself. I've been working profesionally as a web developer for over 6 years now and if you were to ask me how I would host a website, I would struggle more than I'd like to admit. With that said, I am glad to say I have a better idea now of how to get an application hosted on the web and I have awareness of the underlying building blocks that hosting a website is built on.
