A lot has happened in my life over the past year. In that timeframe, I got married, I bought a home, and I am now a father. With these big life events came a new set of responsibilites and obligations. Taking care of the home, being a good husband, being a good father. This is the most limited in my time to pursure my personal ambitions. I still have a strong desire to pursure my aspirations and I hope this blog will keep me moving towards that endeavor.

## Why a Blog?

Having ideas only sit in my head is not a great way for me to open up opportunities with my thoughts. There is so much I want to learn, understand, apply and share in my lifetime. Often times, it is overwhelming because of all the things I want to do coupled with all the things I am responsible for. It is cliche but I need to remember to start small and from there I can begin to build upon what I started. Recording my thoughts here are the small steps to help me begin processing and evaluating whats going on in my head. Taking the time to write these posts provide a place for me to reflect and build upon something more tangible than just an idea in my head. And I get the added bonus of having those thoughts documented in a place that can be more easily shared.

So, what do I plan to write about in this blog? It will be all things I find interesting. Learning new skills, navigating through adulthood, understanding the world we live in to name a few. More immediately, the next few posts will probably be regarding the setup and (hopefully) improvement of my personal site and blog. For a good amount of the things I plan to write about, I hope it is educational at the very least.

With that, I will close this post out. There is so much more I want to write about but lets hold off on writing more and get this post published so that I can take my first baby step with the blog and so that this post can be now available for the world to see!

Cheers!
