What a year it has been. I got married, I bought a home, and I am now a father. With these big life events came a new set of obligations that has left me with limited time for myself. I still have a strong desire to pursure my personal ambition but with my new set of responsibilities, I can no longer operate as I once did if I wish to continue that pursuit. I have to be more calculated in my approach and even more disciplined with my time if I wish to keep seeking my aspirations. This blog I hope can be a pillar that will support me as I keep pushing fowards.

## Why a Blog?

Recording my ideas in a post is something small I can consistenly commit to. It provides a starting point for me to build off of. In the event I run out of time and or don't have the energy to write a post, I can always pick up from where I left off. More importantly taking the time to document my ideas out helps me further process, reflect, and evaluate whats going on in my head. Writing blog posts makes sense to be a cornerstone of my process as it enables me to find clarity and focus in my efforts.

So, what do I plan to write about in this blog? It will be all things I find interesting. Learning new skills, navigating through adulthood, understanding the world we live in to name a few. More immediately, the next few posts will probably be regarding the setup and (hopefully) improvement of my personal site and blog. For a good amount of the things I plan to write about, I hope it is educational at the very least.

With that, let us close this post out. There is so much more I want to write about but will hold off so that this post can be published and I can take my first baby steps towards my goals!

Cheers!
