A lot has happened in my life over the past year. In that timeframe, I got married, I bought a home, and I am now a father. With these big life events came a new set of responsibilites and obligations I intend to fulfill. Taking care of the home, being a good husband, being a good father and parent. This is the most limited I have ever been in my time and energy to pursure my personal ambitions. I still have aspirations of things I want do in my lifetime and that desire has not faded. This blog I hope can help me keep movings towards those dreams.

## Why a Blog?

I love the idea of documenting my thoughts. Having ideas sit in my head is not the best place for me if I hope to open up opportunities with them. There is so much I want to learn, understand, apply and share in my lifetime. Often times, it is overwhelming because of all the things I want to do coupled with all the thing I am responsible for. Recording my thoughts will help me process and evaluate whats going on in my head and taking the time to write these posts will produce something tangible and accomplishes my hope to share those ideas.

So, what do I plan to write about in this blog? It will be all things I find interesting. Learning new skills, navigating through adulthood, understand the world we live in to name a few. More immediately, I think my next post will cover how this blog was stood up (Hugo), how I decided on hosting it (GitHub Pages) and covering basics in understanding how the web works. For all the things I plan to write about, I hope it is educational at the least and hopefully it can be helpful if anyone is facing a similar situation needing some direction in making a decision.

With that, I will close this post out. There is so much more I want to write about, so I will work on that next post but lets get this post published so that I can take my first baby step with standing this blog up and this post can now be available for the world to see!

Cheers!
