What a year it has been. I got married, I bought a home, and I am now a father. With these big life events came a new set of obligations that has left me with limited time for myself. I still have a strong desire to pursure my personal ambition but with the new set of responsibilities, I can no longer operate as I once did if I wish to continue that pursuit. I have to be calculated in my approach and disciplined with my time if I wish to keep seeking my aspirations. This blog I hope can be a pillar that will enable me to keep pushing towards my goals.

## Why a Blog?

There is so much I want to learn, understand, apply and share in my lifetime. Often times, it is overwhelming and paralyzing because of all the things I want to do coupled with all the things I am responsible for. To keep myself moving forward, I have been telling myself to:

1. **Prioritize time for myself**\
If I can not make time for myself consistently, I'm not going to be able to build the momentum to keep moving towards a goal

2. **Take small steps**\
I accept that my time is limited given my situation. I value my relationship with my wife. I value raising my daughter and watching her grow. Taking small steps was the sensible approach.

Recording my ideas in a post is something small I can consistenly commit to. It provides a starting point for me to build off of. In the event I run out of time and or don't have the energy to write a post, I can always pick up from where I left off. More importantly taking the time to document my ideas out helps me further process, reflect, and evaluate whats going on in my head. Writing blog posts makes sense to be a cornerstone of my process as it enables me to find clarity and focus in my efforts and in turn keeps me moving foward.

So, what do I plan to write about in this blog? It will be all things I find interesting. Learning new skills, navigating through adulthood, understanding the world we live in to name a few. More immediately, the next few posts will probably be regarding the setup and (hopefully) improvement of my personal site and blog. For a good amount of the things I plan to write about, I hope it is educational at the very least.

With that, let us close this post out. There is so much more I want to write about but will hold off so that this post can be published and I can take my first baby steps towards my goals!

Cheers!
