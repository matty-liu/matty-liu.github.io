## Make Time For Yourself

I mentioned earlier that I am now a married man with a child and a home. Those responilsibilties that come along with being a homeowner, husband,and father has really forced me to rethink how I allocate my time. When I was single, I did not have many issues working long hours. I was able to continue bettering my skills as a programmer and oftentimes before I knew it, it was 8PM and time for dinner, shower, and bed. Now that I'm married and have a child, being a good and available husband and father is important to me and I really can not work those same hours anymore. I enjoy spending time with my wife and cooking dinner for her, I enjoy watching my daughter grow. But if I'm working till 8PM, my wife definitely is not getting a home cooked meal, and my daughter will most likely be in bed and if she is awake it probably ain't a pleasent situation.

And this brings me to the first thing I've been trying to help focus my time is to set clear boundries and have a schedule. Setting up the schedule was the easy part. I was able to see that I have windows open where I can spend time doing things. The part of setting "clear boundries" is what has been difficult for me as there is a mindset shift I need to have.

Societally, we kind of know not to make plans Monday-Friday between the times of 9AM-5PM. When I typically make plans with others, we know to look for times outside of that work window. Depending on importance, I will potentially push aside my personal timeslots for other plans that come up. But if I hope to continue to grow the way I hope to, I need to treat those events slotted in those timeframe with the same reverence that a lot of have for work time. If there are plans that come up, I need to have the appropiate mindset that if I have chosen to slot time into the calendar that the default should be those events are unmovable. But with this, it is pushing myself to be more disciplined and more focused knowing that my time is limited. This has probably been the most I've said "no" in my life when making plans with others. This has also forced me constantly rethink what is really important to me and help cut out things that don't really matter.

MWF 8AM-9AM Workout
WMF 5PM-7PM Personal Projects
WM 7PM-9PM Family Time
TT 5PM-6PM Cook
TT 6PM-9PM Family Time
W or T 8PM-9PM Tennis
F 6PM-9PM Basketball
SS Family Time

So from 7AM-9AM, if I have workout scheduled, then little work things should not push my working out time. If 5PM-8PM is reservered for family, then if work is running late and 5PM hits, you need to just say hey, I will continue this tomorrow. Obviously there are certain situation where the tradeoff might be worthwhile. But generally speaking this type of mentality shift for me has been extremely difficult for me. By my nature, I have always tried to be very fluid with my time. It made me a go to person, should anything go wrong, those around me knew they could count on me. But with the family now, I have been saying no to others when I get request in the off hours. What I've noticed though now is that it has forced other to be mindful of my time.

My progress:
  hosted blog for other to see (check!).
  Lost some weight. 245lb (September 1, 2024).  240lb (October 1, 2024).

I hope this blog becomes a place I can share what I've learned and encourages me to continue to grow. I hope it deepens my understanding of the world and provides clarity to myself of the place I'm trying to get to. And because I want this to be public for the world to see, I can share a part of me with others.
