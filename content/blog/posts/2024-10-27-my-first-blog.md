What a year it has been. I got married, I bought a home, and I am now a father. With these big life events came a new set of obligations that has left me with limited time for myself. I still have a strong desire to pursure my personal ~~ambition~~ curiosity but with my new set of responsibilities, ~~I can no longer operate as I once did if I wish to continue that pursuit~~  it has becomes increasingly difficult to stay focused on that pursuit in a timely manner. ~~I have to be more calculated in my approach and even more disciplined with my time if I wish to keep seeking my aspirations.~~ This blog I hope can be a pillar that I can come back to and build off from when I am able to find the time to explore that curiousity.

## Why a Blog?

As a person responsible with taking care of a young child, finding time to complete things get increasingly harder the longer the tasks take. Recording my ideas in a post is something small and simple ~~I can consistenly commit to~~ I can come back and add to when I have the time. It is a checkpoint where I may resume building off from where I left of with minimal effort compared to other outputs. In the event I don't have the energy to finish a thought cause I'm exhausted from taking care of home/family/child/work/finances/etc..., I can read my last in progress post, and pick up from where I left off.

The other main benefit for me to write a blog is going through the documentation process of my ideas. The act of documenting helps me further process, reflect, and evaluate whats going on in my head. Writing blog posts given my circumstances makes sense to be a tool I use to find clarity in my curiosity.

So, what do I plan to write about in this blog? It will be all things I find interesting. Learning new skills, navigating through adulthood, understanding the world we live in to name a few. More immediately, the next few posts will probably be regarding the setup and (hopefully) improvement of my personal site and blog. For a good amount of the things I plan to write about, I hope it is educational at the very least.

With that, let us close this post out. There is so much more I want to write about but will hold off so that this post can be published and I can take my first baby steps towards my goals!

Cheers!

EDITED: 9/25/2025 - Added strikethrough to previous post after reflection of post and another year of fatherhood of more sensible expectations.
