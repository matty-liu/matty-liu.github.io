A lot has happened in my life over the past year. I got married, bought a home, and am now a father to start. With these big life events came a new set of responsibilites that has taken my time and focus. I still have aspirations of things I hope to do in my lifetime and that desire has not faded even with my new found responsibilties. This blog I hope is one of the first steps to helping my continue to move forwards towards my aspirations.

## My Blog

I love the idea of documenting my thoughts. Having ideas sit in my head is not the best place for me if I hope to open up opportunities from them. There is so much I want to learn, understand, apply and share in my lifetime. Often times, it is overwhelming because of all the things I hope to do with all the obligations I have. By recording my thoughts, I hope that will in turn help me process and evaluate whats going on in my head. Taking the time to write these posts will produce something more tangible than an idea and it also becomes something that is visible for others to see.

Standing up the blog portion of the site has taken a few weeks. I thought about using some hosted CMS service (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) but I wanted to see what it would take to host this blog posts myself. I've been working profesionally as a web developer for over 6 years now and if you were to ask me how I would host a website, I would struggle more than I'd like to admit. With that said, I am glad to say I have a better idea now of how to get an application hosted on the web and I have awareness of the underlying building blocks that hosting a website is built on.

With that, there are so many ideas in my head I want to write about, but I will close this post out so we can publish this post for the world to see!

Cheers!
