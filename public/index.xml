      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in my life over the past year. I got married, bought a home, and am now a father to start. With these big life events came a new set of responsibilites that has taken my time and focus. I still have aspirations of things I hope to do in my lifetime and that desire has not faded even with my new found responsibilties. This blog I hope is one of the first steps to helping my continue to move forwards towards my aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
