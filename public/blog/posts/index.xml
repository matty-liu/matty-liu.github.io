      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-first-personal-blog-site&#34;&gt;My First Personal Blog Site&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since I started programming professionally. I got married, bought a home, and am now a father. With all these big life changing events, I now have to be a lot more disciplined with my time to learn the things I want to learn. To support this desire, I figured setting up a personal blog would help me stay focused in that pursuit. I love the idea of documenting my my thought process and having those thoughts are out there for others to see. Personally I hope my blog posts are educational as that helps me solidfy the new things I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
